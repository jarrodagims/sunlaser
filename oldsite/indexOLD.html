	<h2>The Most Advanced Laser Vision Correction Technology in El Paso</h2>
    <h2><div style="color:#03C;">ALL NEW INTRALASE IFS LASER</div></h2>
    
    <p><img src="img/intral7.jpg" width="205" height="94" alt="100% Blade Free Lasik Experience" class="floatRight" />Featuring blade-free LASIK with the all new Intralase IFS laser, we provide the safest, most advanced laser vision technology available.  We are the only laser surgical practice in El Paso to have a fixed IFS and VISX Star S4 IR platform.<br /><br />

We offer a wide range of surgical options for vision correction including iLASIK, advanced surface ablation, epi-LASIK and intacs placement.  We perform custom corneal correction using the VISX Wavefront analyzer which measures and treats subtle optical abnormalities unique to an individual’s eyes.  Our VISX excimer laser is enabled with pupil tracking and iris registration improving both safety and accuracy. <br /><br />

The flexibility offered by having the most advanced technology allows us to tailor the procedure best suited to an individual.  This ensures the greatest possibility of excellent results while remaining committed to patient safety first.</p>

<h2>A little background…</h2>

<p>Laser vision correction is a truly remarkable surgery.  The safety and precision of the lasers we use to re-contour corneal tissue at the micron level has continually improved achieving better and better results.  The overwhelming majority of those who have laser vision correction happily view it as a positive life changing experience.<br /><br />

Laser vision correction has rapidly evolved since the first procedures were performed in the early 1990s.  Among the developments is the use of the scanning spot excimer lasers that improve precision and minimize tissue removal.  The advent of custom wavefront technology has resulted in improved results by more precisely measuring nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism as well as optical abnormalities not correctable with glasses.  Pupil tracking and iris registration are other developments that ensure excellent centering and alignment of the treatment.  There have also been technical changes in the way procedures are performed.<br /><br />

Femtosecond lasers used in all laser LASIK (iLASIK) allow us to create a flap more safely and reliably than older equipment which used blades.  Advanced surface techniques, LASEK and epi-LASiK, have led to refined outcomes and have largely replaced PRK.  Advances in both surface and LASIK techniques have resulted in more patients having better vision than they ever had with glasses or contacts before surgery.</p>

	<h2>About Dr. Michael Foote</h2>
    <p> Dr. Foote is an El Paso native and a third-generation physician.  He is board certified by the American Board of Ophthalmology, providing comprehensive general ophthalmic care. He received his undergraduate bachelor of arts at the University of Texas at Austin in 1994.  In 1998 he graduated from the University Texas Medical Branch at Galveston with his medical degree.  He completed his internship in general internal medicine also in Galveston before moving to Kansas City, Kansas to complete his training residency in ophthalmology at Kansas University Medical Center. He graduated from Kansas University Medical Center in 2002.  Evaluation and management of refractive surgery patients was a core component of his ophthalmology training. <br /><br />

Dr. Foote has been providing eye care to El Pasoans since returning home in 2002.  He opened his own practice in 2005 focusing primarily in refractive, cataract and corneal surgery as well as management of general ocular disease.  <br /><br />

Dr. Foote is also involved in medical missionary work abroad.  This work has taken him to Mexico and Guatemala where for several years he has helped treat many patients with blindness due to advanced cataracts and other eye diseases.  </p>
