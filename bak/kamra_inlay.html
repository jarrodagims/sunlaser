                             <p  class="lead mb64 mb-xs-24">The KAMRA® inlay is intended for placement in the non-dominant eye of patients who are between the ages of 45 and 60 years old, who have not had cataract surgery, who are unable to focus clearly on near objects or small print, who do not need glasses or contact lenses for clear distance vision and who need reading glasses with +1.00 to +2.50 diopters of power.</p>

                            <h5 class="uppercase mb16">Finally - a solution for reading glasses!</h5>
                             <p  class="lead mb64 mb-xs-24">
Maybe you have a pair of them in the car, on the night stand, at your desk, at the bottom of your purse or somewhere on your workbench and a dozen other places but seemingly never around right when you need them?   Well if you’re tired of the frustration and hassle, there is now a laser surgical option that can help to restore your near vision and reduce or eliminate your need for reading glasses or bifocals.  <br>

The loss of our near vision is one of the greater frustrations that we deal with as we celebrate perhaps a few too many birthdays!  Reading glasses become a not so welcome reminder of our aging.  At times they may even seem to sap your sense of vitality right at the time in life when you’re reaching the pinnacle of your work and home life.   
</p>


                            <h5 class="uppercase mb16">But with the all new Kamra Inlay, that outlook on life is about to change.</h5>
                             <p  class="lead mb64 mb-xs-24">
The Kamra Inlay is a wafer thin (6 microns or the width of a human red blood cell) surgical implant designed to be placed within the cornea of the eye (the clear tissue overlying the iris and pupil).  It creates what is called small aperature optic effect allowing only focused light to enter the eye generating greater depth of focus and with it, the restoration of near vision. <br> 

The Kamra Inlay does not degrade distance vision and may actually improve it in some patients.  It is reversible/removable if necessary with return of the preoperative vision after removal in virtually all patients.  However the removal rate has been less than 3% world-wide to date.   The overall patient satisfaction rate has been very high.<br>

The Kamra inlay is generally recommended in patients age 45 to 60 who have no significant cataract and no corneal disease (keratoconus, prior RK, severe dry eye, corneal dystrophies).  It is generally not recommended for patients with macular degeneration or diabetes or a strong family history of either disorder.   It is an FDA approved device and is made of a polymer that has been used in eye surgery for decades.<br>

                        <p class="lead mb10">Don't see your question?<a href="#">@SunLaserVision</a> if you've got more questions.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What is the KAMRA inlay?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay is a safe, proven and lasting solution to restore everyday near vision.  Smaller and thinner than a contact lens, the inlay is a film-like ring with an opening in the center.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How does KAMRA Vision work?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay provides a more natural range of vision. It works on the same principle as a small camera aperture by increasing the depth of focus. The opening in the inlay allows only focused light into the eye, allowing you to see near, far and everything in-between.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Who can benefit from KAMRA Vision?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> KAMRA Vision may be ideal for individuals over 40 seeking a solution to restore their everyday near vision and reduce their dependence on glasses or contact lenses.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What benefits does KAMRA Vision provide?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> KAMRA Vision:<br>
                          Provides freedom to enjoy everyday activities without glasses<br>
                          Restores clarity at near and intermediate (computer) vision<br>
                        Maintains distance vision</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will my distance vision change?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong> </strong> Unlike monovision LASIK, contact lenses or multifocal lens implants that can significantly compromise distance vision, KAMRA Vision restores near and intermediate vision while maintaining distance vision.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: If it doesn’t affect my distance vision, then why is it put in only one eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay is only placed in one eye allowing you to see up close, while maintaining your distance vision. Your other eye is either left untouched or is corrected for great distance vision. Working together, the eyes allow you to see near, far and everything in-between.. </p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How long will KAMRA Vision last? Do I need to replace the inlay if my presbyopia worsens?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> KAMRA Vision is the lasting solution to presbyopia. Assuming your eyes don’t change, the effect of the KAMRA inlay will go unchanged. However, with the development of cataracts or changes in your underlying prescription you may need an enhancement (i.e. LASIK or cataract surgery). This will be advised by your doctor.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What material is used to make the KAMRA inlay?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay is comprised of a proven biocompatible material frequently used in a wide variety of eye and other medical implants, called polyvinylidene fluoride. In addition, the inlay has been tested and implanted safely in thousands of eyes.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How big is the KAMRA inlay?</strong></h5>
              <p> <strong>A: </strong>Smaller and thinner than a contact lens, the inlay is a film-like ring with an opening in the center. The inlay is 3.8mm in diameter with a 1.6mm opening in the center.It is 5 microns thick (or the thickness of a red blood cell and one tenth the thickness of a sheet of paper).</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will I feel the inlay in my eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Unlike a contact lens, the inlay is placed within the first few layers of the cornea so it is not felt. There have been no reports of patients feeling the inlay.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How does KAMRA Vision work?</strong></h5>
              <p> <strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay provides a more natural range of vision. It works on the same principle as a small camera aperture by increasing the depth of focus. The opening in the inlay allows only focused light into the eye, allowing you to see near, far and everything in-between.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will people be able to see the inlay in my eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Depending on the size of your pupil, color of your eye, and the lighting conditions,the KAMRA inlay is virtually invisible.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will the KAMRA inlay darken my vision?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A: </strong>The inlay is designed to help your eye focus the light so images and text look clear again. Right after the inlay is implanted, you may notice some dimness, but as you adapt to the inlay, there will be little to no dimness noticed.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will the inlay decrease my peripheral vision?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The inlay does not affect your side, or peripheral vision.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Does the inlay move in my eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The inlay does not move once it is placed in the eye it instantly adheres to the corneal tissue.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How new is the KAMRA™ inlay?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>KAMRA Vision is not a new technology.  Thousands of people including eye doctors are choosing KAMRA Vision as their preferred near vision treatment.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Can the inlay be removed?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay has been proven to be the safe and effective solution for reducing the need for reading glasses. If at some point in the future you wish to have the inlay removed, please contact your KAMRA doctor to schedule a consultation.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What can I expect during the surgery?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> Smaller and thinner than a contact lens, the inlay is a film-like ring with an opening in the center. The inlay is 3.8mm in diameter with a 1.6mm opening in the center.It is 5 microns thick (or the thickness of a red blood cell and one tenth the thickness of a sheet of paper).</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How is the KAMRA inlay placed in the eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Using a laser, a flap is created under a very thin layer of the cornea. The same technique is used in LASIK. The inlay is then placed underneath the flap.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What are the side effects after the KAMRA procedure?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>Your eye care provider will thoroughly discuss all of the potential side effects with you before surgery. The most common side effects include dry eye, glare, halos and night vision disturbances. These are the same conditions you would experience with LASIK or PRK. Over time, these conditions are expected to resolve or lessen.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Is there any pain during the surgery?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A: </strong>There can be pressure during the creation of the flap; however, numbing drops will ensure your comfort during the procedure.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Can you tell me more about the laser used to create the flap?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The KAMRA inlay provides a more natural range of vision. It works on the same principle as a small camera aperture by increasing the depth of focus. The opening in the inlay allows only focused light into the eye, allowing you to see near, far and everything in-between.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will I notice an immediate improvement?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Your recovery will depend on your personal healing patterns. While some patients see an improvement within the first week to a month, others may require additional time.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How much of an improvement can I expect?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The inlay is designed to help your eye focus the light so images and text look clear again. Right after the inlay is implanted, you may notice some dimness, but as you adapt to the inlay, there will be little to no dimness noticed.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How soon after the surgery can I resume normal activities?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>Most patients resume normal activities and return to work within 24 hours.Your doctor will discuss your specific recovery process with you in more detail.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will I still need to wear reading glasses?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>The goal of the inlay is to reduce your dependency on reading glasses.  You may still need magnification if you are working in dim light, performing a near task for prolonged period of time or reading tiny print.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: How can I achieve the best results?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>You can aid your healing process by using post-op medications and artificial drops as prescribed. Furthermore, you can accelerate your visual recovery by regularly performing reading exercises provided by your doctor and not using reading glasses when performing near tasks.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Do I really need to come back for a post-op check-up?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A: </strong>As with any surgery,post-op checkups are very important. Your doctor will want to follow your progress. While we do not anticipate any, some postoperative issues are only detected by special assessments and may go unnoticed by the patient.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Is it normal to experience blurry vision or fluctuations?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is common to experience these symptoms on and off during the first 3 to 6 months. This is often a sign of dry eye or your brain adapting to the new vision. Use your eye drops and give your eyes frequent breaks.If the condition persists contact your KAMRA doctor for a consultation.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q:   What is presbyopia?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> The lens in your eye is stretchy and flexible. With time the lens stiffens. As a result it can no longer bend into the right shapes to bring close objects into focus. To compensate, you end up moving objects further away at just the right distance to focus. This is why you start holding reading materials at arm’s length.The clinical term is presbyopia (prez-bee-‘O-pee-uh) and it happens to everyone eventually.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q:  What are the other presbyopic treatments in the market?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A: </strong>The most common presbyopic treatments in the market are corrective eyewear, such as reading glasses or contact lenses, and monovision with LASIK. These options all come with compromise. Reading glasses and contact lenses are inconvenient and need to be updated if your prescription changes. Monovision is a LASIK procedure which treats one eye for distance and one eye for near. The compromise with monovision is that it does sacrifice some of your distance vision for clear near vision, and it is not reversible.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What if I already had eye surgery?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> If you had prior eye surgery, you may still be a candidate for KAMRA Vision™. A full assessment is needed to determine if you qualify for the treatment.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: What will happen if I develop cataracts?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> Should you develop a cataract, your doctor can easily remove and replace it withan artificial lens. Your inlay will continue to provide excellent near and intermediate vision.  It’s important to note that the inlay shouldn’t increase any risks associated with having the cataract removed.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: Will there be better and newer treatment available in the near future?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A: </strong>There are always possibilities of advancements in the medical field. The benefit of the KAMRA™   inlay is that it can be used in conjunction with other treatments or it can be removed,allowing patients the option to take advantage of future technology development.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q:  Am I a suitable candidate for KAMRA Vision if I have allergies or dry eye?</strong></h5>
                        <p> <strong>A:</strong> Yes you may still be an excellent candidate for KAMRA Vision. To determine if you’re eligible your eyes will need to be assessed by your doctor. If you do get the inlay, it is important to follow your doctor’s recommendations when managing your symptoms.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb0"><strong>Q: I wear bifocals; can I still have the surgery?</strong></h5>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes depending upon the results of your clinical evaluation.</p>
